## Notes for docker

- Docker **start** command will start any stopped container. If you used docker **create** command to create a container, you can start it with this command. Docker **run**  command is a combination of create and start as it creates a new container and starts it immediately.

- **"docker system prune"** command will delete all stopped containers.
